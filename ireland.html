  <h1>Ireland</h1>
  <p>Ireland's rich culture, enchanting green landscapes and friendly locals are just a few reasons why so many travelers make the journey to this island country.</p>

    <h2>Dublin</h2>
    <p>If you only have time to visit one place in Ireland, go to Dublin. Not only is Dublin the country's hub for politics, culture and music, but it also offers easy 
       ccess to Blarney Castle, one of Ireland's top points of interest. While here, do as the Irish do and savor some brews either at the popular Guinness Storehouse or 
       at the always exuberant Temple Bar</p>

       <h2>Cliffs of Moher</h2>
       <p>The Cliffs of Moher are Ireland's most popular tourist attraction, welcoming more than 1 million visitors each year. In fact, the cliffs are so popular that cities 
          situated more than 100 miles away often offer daylong tours to the attraction. Once you lay eyes on this sight, you'll understand why so many people travel hours to
          gaze at it. Measuring 5 miles long and more than 700 feet tall, the cliffs provide breathtaking views of Galway Bay, parts of Connemara National Park and the Aran Islands 
          on a clear day.</p>

          <h2>Wicklow Mountains</h2>
          <p>The Wicklow Mountains are a convenient outdoor escape for many travelers thanks to their location about 30 miles southwest of Dublin. Occupying a national park of 
             the same name, the Wicklow Mountains offer countless sights and activities for visitors to enjoy. Start by exploring the mountain range's evergreen heaths, bogs, 
             peaks, cliffs, valleys and forests via popular hikes like the Bray Head Cliff Walk and the Wicklow Way. Then, check out Glendalough, which features beautiful 
             landscapes, as well as historical ruins.</p>

             <h2>Connemara National Park</h2>
             <p>Expect awe-inspiring scenery everywhere you turn when you visit this 5,000-acre national park during the warmer months. Connemara National Park is home to four 
                mountain ranges, plus woodlands, grasslands, heaths (wild, undeveloped flatlands) and bogs (wetlands) that you can explore via one of several trails. To get a 
                good overview of the park's diverse scenery, hike the Diamond Hill paths, the Cong and Clonbur Forest Trail and the Killary Harbour Coastal Walk. The latter is 
                where you'll find Ireland's only fjord.</p>

                <h2>Tralee</h2>
                <p>Base yourself in Tralee if seeing the Wild Atlantic Way and the Ring of Kerry are two of your Ireland must-dos. In addition to sitting close to these two top 
                   scenic routes, the town is home to several noteworthy attractions, including the Kerry County Museum (a local history museum), Tralee Town Park (one of Ireland's 
                   largest urban parks) and Ardfert Cathedral (a historical property with medieval and Romanesque features). What's more, Tralee is where you'll find the Tralee 
                   Bay Wetlands Centre, a wildlife haven with opportunities for everything from canoeing to fishing to water zorbing.</p>
