  <h1>Japan</h1>

    <h2>Kyoto</h2>
    <p>Travelers most interested in Japan's history and traditions should head to Kyoto. Centrally located on the archipelago, 
       Kyoto has long been considered the cultural capital of Japan. Here, you'll find more than 1,000 Buddhist temples and 400-plus 
       Shinto shrines, including a whopping 17 UNESCO World Heritage sites. You can also stroll through geisha districts like Gion and 
       Miyagawacho, admire classic wooden architecture and visit traditional teahouses before checking out more modern attractions, such as the Kyoto Aquarium.</p>

       <h2>Tokyo</h2>
       <p>This metropolis is a feast for the senses. Neighborhoods like Ginza and Akihabara buzz with flashing lights and larger-than-life shopping, 
          while Meiji Shrine and the Imperial Palace give you a look into Japan's storied past. There are also a number of green spaces like Shinjuku 
          Gyoen National Garden, which acts as a place to escape from the chaotic, concrete jungle. What's more, Tokyo is regularly regarded as a top 
          foodie city thanks in part to its abundant Michelin-starred restaurants (the most you'll find in any city in the world), so come hungry.</p>

          <h2>Mount Fuji</h2>
          <p>The country's tallest mountain and one of its most iconic symbols is a popular destination for outdoor recreation. For centuries, Japanese artists 
             and poets have been inspired by Mount Fuji's almost perfectly round form. The Fuji Five Lakes region at the foot of this UNESCO World Heritage Site 
             makes a great base for the thousands of climbers who visit each year. Enjoy the area's museums and amusement park during the warmer months. Or, arrive
              in winter to soak in the hot springs and ski Mount Fuji's slopes.</p>

             <h2>Nara</h2>
             <p>Japan's first permanent capital is famous for housing the Great Buddha, a more than 50-foot-tall bronze statue of Buddha. You'll find this jaw-dropping
                 national treasure in Nara's Todai-ji temple, which is the largest wooden building in the world. While on the temple grounds, explore the deer-filled Nara
                 Park and the ornate Kasuga Taisha shrine. Also save time for visiting Yakushiji Temple, a property that's considered one of the Seven Great Temples of Nara.</p>

                <h2>Osaka</h2>
                <p>Situated about 35 miles southwest of Kyoto, this port city is worth a visit for its food alone. One of the city's most famous dishes, the tasty pancake-like 
                   okonomiyaki (which means "grilled as you like it" in Japanese), is made with batter, cabbage and your choice of meat and other toppings. After you've gotten 
                   your fill of the delectable local cuisine, explore the flashy Dotonbori neighborhood, check out the reconstructed 16th-century Osaka Castle or head to 
                   contemporary sights like Universal Studios Japan and the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan.</p>
